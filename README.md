# Django-Based-Server

The platform used for hosting the Server is Django-Python.

Functionality of Server: 
Consider a scenario when a student has just received his/her result for a very important exam.
The server will provide with a graphical database, where students can select there preferences from which College
and Department they want to appear.

Given the rank, we now allocate this Students seats in the Institutions in accordance with constraints of capacity, quota, 
multiple rounds of applications etc.

Just like the Website hosted by Institutes like IIT for seat allocation.

Please feel free to dig and inform me about any bugs you come across :)
